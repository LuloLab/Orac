# Orac - Unity Project

This is my first game demo made in the first few months of the covid-19 epidemic.
At that moment I have little skill about modeling and music, and the completion of this project is very low.
I have been wanting to polish the project for a long time, but recently I think that it's better for me to focus on new fancy game ideas than to spend time with the old one (Maybe I'm a lazy boy).
So I hereby share the code and formally say arrivederci to this project.

The windows release build can be found at <https://lulolab.itch.io/orac>.

*¡Adios, Unity! y ¡Hola, Unreal!*
